= ANF

ANF is an FNA-like framework for 2D games in Rust. It's powered by https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA3D[FNA3D] and https://www.libsdl.org/[SDL2].

== About

ANF and https://github.com/toyboot4e/rust-fna3d[Rust-FNA3D] is still early in progress and it **only runs on macOS** out of the box (or you may have to manually link to FNA3D, which I don't know how. I've been learning).

Installation:

```sh
$ # clone ANF and FNA3D
$ git clone 'https://github.com/toyboot4e/anf/' --recursive
$ cd anf
$ cd rust-fna3d/fna3d-sys
$ git clone 'https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA3D' --recursive
$ # build MojoShader
$ cd FNA3D/MojoShader
$ cmake .
$ cd ../
$ # build FNA3D
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. && make
```

API documentation can be generated and opened with `cargo doc --no-deps --open`.
