= ANF

ANF is a 2D framework in Rust. It's powered by https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA3D[FNA3D] and https://www.libsdl.org/[SDL2]. It runs on desktops.

== About

See the https://docs.rs/anf[API documentation] to get started.

ANF is just for https://github.com/toyboot4e/rlbox[my roguelike game development] and it's not a feature-complete framework. You would only need 5 minutes to get the whole picture.

== Feedback

Feel free to contact with me! Via issues, email or maybe https://bit.ly/rust-community[Rust Community Discord].
