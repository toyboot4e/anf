= ANF

ANF is an FNA-like 2D framework

== Choice of language and libraries

=== Why Rust?

Because I like it. I didn't have justification, but this article did it and I found it nice:

=== Why using FNA3D & SDL2?

I can't explain pros and cons compared to using other libraries (yet).

You might prefer 100% rustic code base, however, "C runs in another languages" is also cool, maybe in a close way as "do everything in Rust" is.
